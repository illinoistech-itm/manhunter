I have a couple of questions on using Lucene in a production environment:

1) Are updates to an index "transactional" in nature?  In other words, can
an index ever get into an inconsistent/corrupt state by killing a writing
process?  If so, is there a way to detect and fix this condition?

2) Can you describe where the synchronization points/locks are applied and
released?  I would like to make sure I avoid any situations that might cause
performance degradation or deadlock in my application.

Thanks! 
Scott

No, it should not be possible to put an index in an inconsistent or corrupt
state.  The only problem might be that, after a crash, lock files may need
to be manually removed.

The primary synchronization point is during calls to IndexReader.open() and
IndexWriter.close().  Only one thread may be in this at a time.  For that
reason, and for others, one should re-use IndexReader instances.  Since
IndexReader is thread-safe, this is not hard.  One IndexReader per index is
all that you should need at a time.  When the index changes, you should
create a new IndexReader.  The IndexReader.lastModified() method is designed
to make this easy.  The typical use should be to cache a single index reader
per index, check to see if it is out of date each time the cache is
accessed, and replace it when it is.

IndexWriter.close() commits changes.  Aborting without closing will leave
the index locked but otherwise consistent.

Does anybody could let me know what should be changed in the "IndexFiles"
demo to let met index and query "pure" digit part number. Currently only
alphabetic query seem to work, digit and special characters (-, _, /, ...)
are ignored.

Thanks

Try using org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer instead of
StopAnalyzer.  This will index numbers, etc.  Have a look at
StandardTokenizer.jj in the sources for details.  If that grammar is not
quite right, copy it and compile your own tokenizer.

Congratulations on the move! The new site looks up and smooth. I know
it's a lot of work to do this stuff, thanks to all the Apache folks
behind the scenes who made it happen. The software collection at
Jakarta just gets better and better.

As near as I can see, the two major changes for 1.2-rc1 are:
  switch to org.apache.lucene package names.
  Apache license instead of LGPL.

Sometime when someone has a chance, I'd love to hear a bit about what
plans there are for Lucene development.

I'm taking my first step in to coding some Lucene
stuff, specifically a custom analyzer. The analyzer
we want is one that maps accented characters to
their unaccented form, for a crude and general
Latin index/search. E.g. e accute to e.
Anyone got one already ?

If not, I can't seem to find the source for Lucene.
I've downloaded 1.02rc1.

I've read the FAQ and seen the examples, so I'm
comfortable with how to do this, I'm just insanely curious
about the code under the bonnet of the StandardAnalyzer.

I wasn't able to use the Web example through the Search.jhtml (I'm using the
JWS FastTrack 4.1). I wonder whether you have a replacement of the jhtml to
a jsp page or a configuration checklist that I could follow to make it work
within that Web server. 
Thank you in advance,

Sorry, the source code did not make it into this release.  It is available
from CVS:
  http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html
  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-lucene/

I'll try to make sure that the source code is in the next release, as it was
before.

Hi,

I downloaded the Lucene API yesterday and like to really use the API. I have
not been able to get the source code for Lucene1.2.

All I have is the lucene-1.2-rc1.jar with some examples in it and the API &
have run the same.

Currently I am trying to search on specific keywords and phrases, but then
the words with characters like
 '_" '@' are never searched for. I would like to solve this problem. But
then overall understanding of the API
is a must. How do I go about the same & also where can I have get the source
code?

Regards,

Sunil Zanjad

This is because you have added some documents with "originType" as an
indexed field, and others with "originType" as an un-indexed field.  Did you
change this in your code after your index was created?  That is not
currently permitted.

As I think about it, I don't think this should be an error.  Please try
making the following change to index/FieldInfos.java.  Change the definition
of add(String,boolean) to:

  private void add(String name, boolean isIndexed) {
    FieldInfo fi = fieldInfo(name);
    if (fi == null)
      addInternal(name, isIndexed);
    else if (isIndexed)		  // if isIndexed in any seg
      fi.isIndexed = true;	  // isIndexed in merged
  }

That should fix your problem, and I don't think it will cause any others.
Please send an email to lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org telling whether this
works.

Doug

I've been porting our application to use the 1.2 release candidate 1 build
and now have a problem opening searchers on our existing indexes.  I get a
Permission Denied exception...  our permissions are set up to allow reading
of the directory and contained files during a search, but not writing.

I know there was some lock-file code added to the latest release, but it
doesn't seem like this should be causing a problem for a searcher that is
read only.

Does anyone have any ideas on what the problem might be?  Should I be
opening the searcher in a different way?

Any help would be appreciated,
Dave Snyder

Hmm.  That is a problem.  The reader now creates a lock file while it is
opening the index to keep a writer process from deleting files while they're
being opened.  When opening an index the reader must first read the list of
files to open, then open them.  If between reading the list and opening a
file that file were to disappear, then the open would fail.  This was the
longstanding race condition that is fixed by the lock files.  A writing
process will now wait for the reader to open all of the files before
updating things.

Perhaps we should instead write lock files in a subdirectory of the index
named "locks".  You could make that directory read/write, but make the
parent read-only.  Alternately, we could have an flag that turns off the use
of lock files, for those who know that there is no other process that is
potentially simultaneously updating the index.  Which approach would folks
prefer?

Yes.  Thanks for pointing these out.  These are big incompatible changes
that I forgot to mention.  

Other changes since 1.01b include:
  - ant-only build -- no more makefiles
  - addition of lock files--now fully thread & process safe
  - addition of German stemmer
  - MultiSearcher now supports low-level search API
  - added RangeQuery, for term-range searching
  - Analyzers can choose tokenizer based on field name
  - misc bug fixes.

I need to work up detailed release notes for the final 1.2 release.

> Sometime when someone has a chance, I'd love to hear a bit about what

Let's see, some short term tasks for the 1.2 release:
  - get source code back into releases
  - clean up example code
  - write release notes

Some mid-term tasks:
  - add contributed Chinese analyzers
  - add Hits.SetOrdering() support
  - add some term highlighting support

Longer term tasks:
  - add JDBC-based Directory
  - optimize simple conjunctive queries
  - optionally store document vectors in index

Have I missed your favorite?

How about adding filters for different file types such as
-HTML (there is one in the demo already)
-XML
-PDF
-MsWord/RTF
-other common file formats

These would be great.  Who will implement them?
I was only listing tasks that I plan to do.

I think the best API for such converters is a method that takes a
java.io.InputStream and returns a java.io.Reader containing plain text,
e.g.:
     public static java.io.InputStream getText(java.io.Reader);
That way they can easily be used by Lucene analyzers.

Should we put converters in org.apache.lucene.document?

Contributions anyone?

How does i2 do it? http://www.i2a.com/websearch/  -
they list both an HTML parser and a PDF parser as part
of their solution.

If wanted to store an index on a read-only medium then would need to
be able to turn off lock file usage altogether, or specify an alternate
directory that wasn't part of the index tree.  Not something I've
ever needed to do, but someone might want to sometime.

Could the lock creation code check for write access to the index
directory and just skip the locks if can't create the file?  If
the index is read-only then nothing is going to be updating it
anyway.

Hi !

  This is because you have added some documents with "originType" as an
  indexed field, and others with "originType" as an un-indexed field.  =
Did you
  change this in your code after your index was created?  That is not
  currently permitted.

  As I think about it, I don't think this should be an error.  Please =
try
  making the following change to index/FieldInfos.java.  Change the =
definition
  of add(String,boolean) to:

    private void add(String name, boolean isIndexed) {
      FieldInfo fi =3D fieldInfo(name);
      if (fi =3D=3D null)
        addInternal(name, isIndexed);
      else if (isIndexed)   // if isIndexed in any seg
        fi.isIndexed =3D true;   // isIndexed in merged
    }

  That should fix your problem, and I don't think it will cause any =
others.

this

  Try using org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer instead =

Hi,
The indexing mechanism fails under the following circumstances. This is what
I tried out
1. Created indexes on a folder containg .doc files
2. Carried out search on a particular words. Result was obtained accurately.
3. Then I again indexed a particular folder and half way I just aborted the
process
4. Carried out the search for the particular words, the end-result was "0
total matching documents"
Hence in event of a thread crash or shutting down of the application or
simple power failure the indexing does not reflect the existing documents
which were indexed previously.
This state is highly inconsistent.
How do I protect my application from this type of failure?
Regards,
Sunil Zanjad

Subject: Does Lucene really work with Java 1.1.8

I am trying to use the 'lucene-1.2-rc1.jar' with a WebObjects 4.5
application, but having problems. WebObjects uses Java 1.1.8. I read on the
jGuru Lucene FAQ that Lucene should work with this version of Java. Is this
correct?

If the latest version of Lucene only works with Java 1.2, can anyone tell me
if I can get an older version that works with Java 1.1.8?

The specific error I am getting is:

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.io.File: method createNewFile()Z not found
   at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(Unknown Source)
   at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(Unknown Source)
   at Application.createIndex(Application.java:38)
   at Application.<init>(Application.java:15)

This occurs when I try to create an empty index with the following method:

public void createIndex() throws Exception {
    String indexPath = "/Local/Users/jbrook/testIndex";
    IndexWriter writer;

    writer = new IndexWriter(indexPath, null, true);
    writer.close();
}

It should, but it looks like it doesn't.  I have logged a bug against this:
  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4049

I think this is worth fixing before a 1.2 final release is made.  The
simplest approach is to turn off file-based locking in JDK 1.1.8.  Is that
acceptable?

Note that that release is still in the com.lucene.* packages.

Hello,

I think PDF-indexing would be the greatest after HTML
for any searcher used in web conditions!

I am also very interested in indexing PDFs! If anybody has
some ideas or supporting libs I would help to implement it!

  Yes.  Thanks for pointing these out.  These are big incompatible =
changes
  that I forgot to mention. =20

  Other changes since 1.01b include:
    - ant-only build -- no more makefiles
    - addition of lock files--now fully thread & process safe
    - addition of German stemmer
    - MultiSearcher now supports low-level search API
    - added RangeQuery, for term-range searching
    - Analyzers can choose tokenizer based on field name
    - misc bug fixes.

  I need to work up detailed release notes for the final 1.2 release.

  Let's see, some short term tasks for the 1.2 release:
    - get source code back into releases
    - clean up example code
    - write release notes

  Some mid-term tasks:
    - add contributed Chinese analyzers
    - add Hits.SetOrdering() support
    - add some term highlighting support

  Longer term tasks:
    - add JDBC-based Directory
    - optimize simple conjunctive queries
    - optionally store document vectors in index

  Have I missed your favorite?

We're having a heck of a time with too many file handles around here.  When
we create large indexes, we often get thousands of temporary files in a
given index!  Even worse, we just plain run out of file handles--even on
boxes where we've upped the limits as much as we think we can!  We've played
around with various settings for the mergeFactor and maxMergeDocs, but these
seem to have at best an indirect effect on the number of temporary files
created.

I'm not very familiar with the Lucene file system yet, so can someone
briefly explain how Lucene works on creating an index?  How does it
determine when to create a new temporary file in the index and when does it
decide to compress the index?  Also, is there any way we could limit the
number of file handles used by Lucene?

This is becoming a huge problem for us, so any insight would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Scott

Thousands, eh?  That seems high.

The maximum number of segments should be f*log_f(N), where f is the
IndexWriter.mergeFactor and N is the number of documents.  The default merge
factor is ten.  There are seven files per segment, plus one per field.  If
we assume that you have three fields per document, then its ten files per
segment.  So to get 1000 files in an index with three fields and a
mergeFactor of ten, you'd need 10 billion documents, which I doubt you have.
(Lucene can't handle more than 2 billion anyway...)

How many fields do you have?  (How many different .f files are there per
segment?)

Have you lowered IndexWriter.maxMergeDocs?  If you, e.g. lowered this to
10,000, then with a million documents you'd have 100 segments, which would
give you 1000 files.  So, to minimize the number of files, keep maxMergeDocs
at Integer.MAX_VALUE, its default.

Another possibility is that you're running on Win32 and obsolete files are
being kept open by IndexReaders and cannot be deleted.  Could that be the
case?

> Even worse, we just plain run out of file

You should endevour to keep just one IndexReader at a time for an index.
When it is out of date, don't close it, as this could break queries running
in other threads, just let it get garbage collected.  The finalizers will
close things and free the file handles.

Assume mergeFactor is ten, the default.  A new segment is created on disk
for every ten documents added, or sooner if IndexWriter.close() is called
before ten have been added.  When the tenth segment of size ten is added,
all ten are merged into a single segment of size 100.  When ten such
segments of size 100 have been added, these are merged into a single segment
containing 1000 documents, and so on.  So at any time there can be no more
than nine segments in each power-of-ten index size.  When optimize() is
called all segments are merged into a single segment.

The exception is that no segments will be created larger than
IndexWriter.maxMergeDocs.  So if this were set to 1000, then when you add
the 10,000th document, instead of merging things into a single segment of
10,000, it would add a tenth segment of size 1000, and keep adding segments
of size 1000 for every 1000 documents added.

> Also, is there any way we

An IndexReader keeps all files in all segments open while it is open.  So to
minimize the number of file handles you should minimize the number of
segments, minimize the number of fields, and minimize the number of
IndexReaders open at once.

An IndexWriter also has all files in all segments open at once.  So updating
in a separate process would also buy you more file handles.

We are experimenting with XML-aware indexing. The approach we're trying
is to index every element in a given XML document as a separate Lucene
document along with a another Lucene document that captures just the
concatenated text content of the document (to handle searching for
phrases across element boundaries), what we're calling the "all-content"
Lucene document.

We are using a "node type" field to distinguish the different types of
XML document constructs we are indexing (elements, comments, PIs, etc.)
and also thought we would use node type to distinguish the "all-content"
document. When we get a hit list, we can then use the node type to
figure out which XML constructs contained the target text and reduce the
per-element Lucene documents to single XML documents for the final query
result. We can also use node type to limit the query (you might want to
search just in PIs or just in comments, for example).

Our question is this: given that for the all-content document we could
either use the default "content" field for the text and the node type
field to label the document as the all-content node or simply use a
different field name for the content (e.g., "alltext" or something),
which of the following queries would tend to perform better? This:

    "some text" AND nodtype:ALL_CONTENT

or:
  
    alltext:"some text"

Or is there any practical difference?

Which way we construct the Lucene document will affect how our front-end
and/or users have to construct queries. It would be slightly more
convenient for front-ends to get the all-content doc by default (using
the "content" field for the text), but we thought the "AND" query needed
to limit searches to just the text (thus ignoring element-specific
searching) might incur a performance penalty.

In a related question, is there anything we can or need to do to
optimize Lucene to handle lots of little Lucene documents? 

Thanks,

Eliot

Elliot,

I'm having trouble getting a clear picture of your indexing scheme.

Could you provide some simple examples, e.g., for the xml:
  <tag1>this is some text
    <tag2>and some other text</tag2>
  </tag1>
would you have something like the following?
  doc1
    node_type: tag1
    contents: this is some text
  doc2
    node_type: tag2
    contents: and some other text
  doc3
    node_type: all_contents
    contents: this is some text and some other text

That would help me.

My first instinct would be to have something like:
  doc1
    tag1: this is some text
    tag2: and some other text
    all-tags: this is some text and some other text
What do you need that that does not achieve?

Doug

     I've been doing a lot of thinking about this same problem, so I
may be a little more in tune with what Elliot's saying.  By the way,
Elliot, I'm very interested in your results.  I considered the basic
approach you're using, but I thought it was a bit extreme in terms of
having zillions of tiny lucene Documents.  I'm working on a quick
kludge that may serve my immediate purposes (if it does, I'm planning
to post the deatils here).

     I think that's exactly what Elliot is intending.

     Name collision - you can have multiple Elements at different
levels, and you may have attributes and tags having the same name.
Obviously one way around this is "Don't do that", but that could get
really tiresome, quickly.

     If you just conflate the elements and attributes under the same
name (i.e. field "blah" contains a concatenated set of values from all
occurrences of both elements and attributes) then your searches become
much more limited in what you can specify.  This is, by the way, the
approach I'm trying out, with a second stage to refine the results and
drop out false positives.  But I'll have to wait on saying any more
about that.

     All of this, of course, is in the context of having arbitrary XML
documents.  If you have predefined XML schemas then you can hand-code
the mappings from elements to lucene document fields.  But then you
trade a heck of a lot of flexibility for a lot of maintenance.

I'm using Lucene to index a set of documents that contain a lot of duplicate
fields.

A simple example of our typical document structure might look like this:

section_title:
    the first section
text:
    this is section 1 text
section_title:
    the second section
text:
    this is section 2 text

If I do a search in section_title for the text "first" then this document is
a hit. However if I then call hits.doc(0).get("section_title"), the section
title with the hit is *not* the field that is returned - the last occurance
of section_title in the document is the one that gets returned.

If I'm not mistaken, this is a bug? Ideally, the section title that made the
document a hit would be returned. Less ideally, but still more desirable
than the current behaviour, would be for the first section title to be
returned, as this is typically what a user sees first when they choose to
view the entire document after seeing it in the search results.

Was the current behaviour intentional/anticipated?

If no one has time to fix this but can point me at the best place to start
I'm willing to attempt to make a fix and contribute a patch. At the moment I
use the results of doc().get("section_title") as part of my search results,
so the current behaviour is leading to slightly strange looking results
pages...

Regards,

Lee Mallabone.

Steven is correct. For each element in the XML document we create a
separate Lucene document with the following fields:

- docid (unique identifier of the input XML document, e.g., file system
path, object ID from a repository, URL, etc.)
- list of ancestor element types
- DOM tree location
- text of direct PCDATA content
- DOM node type (Element_node, processing_instruction_node,
comment_node) [This list is probably imcomplete but it was enough for us
to test the idea.]
- For each attribute of the element, a field whose name is the attribute
name and whose value is the attribute value.

We also capture all the text content of the input XML document as a
single Lucene document with the same docid and the node type
"all_content". 

Given these Lucene documents, I can do queries like this:

   big brown dog AND ancestor:tag2 AND NOT ancestor:tag3 and
language:english

This will result in one doc for each element instance that contains the
text "big brown dog", is within a tag2 element, not within a tag3
element and has the value "english" for its language attribute.

To make sure you match the phrase if it crosses element boundaries, just
include the all-content doc as well:

   big brown dog ((AND ancestor:tag2 AND NOT ancestor:tag3 and
language:english) OR
   (nodetype:ALL_CONTENT))

Given this set of Lucene docs, we can then collect them by docid to
determine which XML documents are represented. The ancestor list and
tree location enable correlating each hit back to its original location
in the input document. It also enables post-processing to do more
involved contextual filtering, such as "find 'foo' in all paras that are
first children of chapters".

We have implemented a first pass at code that does this indexing but we
have no idea how it will perform (we only got this fully working
yesterday and haven't had time to stress it yet).

I agree that this is somewhat "twisted". In fact my collegue John
Heintz, who suggested the approach of one Lucene doc per element,
characterized the idea as an "abuse" of Lucene's design. But we haven't
been able to think of a better or easier way to do it.

It was really easy to write the DOM processing code to generate this
index and the interaction with Lucene's API couldn't have been
easier--this is my first experience programming against Lucene and I'm
really impressed with the simplicity of the API and the power of the
architecture. 

The functionality described above for XML retrieval already surpasses
anything I know how to do with Verity, Fulcrum, Excallibur, etc. and it
was freaky easy to do once we got the idea for the approach. I just hope
it performs adequately.

Cheers,

E.

From reading the docs, my understanding is that you want to enable both
case sensitive and insensitive searches that you must have two indexes,
one that uses a case-insensitive analyzer, and one that uses a case
sensitive one--is this correct?

You can have one index, but two fields. One with the text all lowercase and
the other with the original text.

We have continued to test our experiment of indexing XML docs by making
one Lucene doc for each element. It seems to be working pretty well,
although we haven't tried any really large-scale tests yet (will try to
do that this coming week).

I did do some informal testing with the World Religions document set
provided by Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems. Using the Xerces DOM
implementation, it took about 75 seconds on a 900mhz PIII laptop to
index the Book of Mormon (which is the biggest of the four works at 1.5
Meg of XML data). Searches across it were essentially instantaneous (but
the index size was small in terms of the scales Lucene can support). I
have not yet profiled the cost of things like collating hit lists by XML
document (that is, all hits with the same docid field), but that should
be purely a function of Java's speed at list iteration, not anything
Lucene does. 

I also wrote client code that takes the treeloc in a given hit and looks
up the corresponding node in the source document's DOM. This code was
very fast too (again, using the Xerces DOM implementation). I had to do
this because we aren't storing any of the XML data in the index itself
(which you could do, but seemed redundant given that the original
documents are still accessible). Given the ability to store pretty much
anything in fields, you could actually capture all of the original XML
data in the Lucene index such that the original document could be
reconsitituted with sufficient fidelity. We are not currently taking
that approach because we don't to add that complexity to the Lucene
index. But it does imply that Lucene could be used as an XML store where
the original input documents are not subsequently kept. (Of course, I
don't know if this approach would preform well enough, but it almost
certainly wouldn't perform worse than existing XML-specific storage
systems that decompose docs at the element level.) [I personally don't
like storage systems that store XML documents only as decomposed bits,
which is why we're not taking that approach in this project--we're
treating the Lucene indexes as purely transient indexes over a
separately-managed authoritative datastore. This protects us, for
example, from changes to the index rules, such as changing fields from
indexed to non-indexed or changing the rules for particular fields. It's
much easier and faster to simply re-index existing docs than to do some
sort of export/re-import process.]

I'm also starting to think about additional contextual information that
could be captured in the index to make it possible to do even more
contextual qualification at the Lucene query level. Will require more
experimentation and thought.

Again, the basic approach is very simple: for a given XML document, walk
the DOM tree, creating one Lucene doc for each element node, where each
Lucene doc has a "docid" field whose value is the same for all docs
created from the same XML document, a "tagname" field, an "ancestors"
field (the ordered list of ancestor element types for the element), a
"treeloc" field, which is the DOM tree location of the element (e.g., 0
1 0 3" for the 4th child of the first child of the second child of the
document element), and a "nodetype" field that indicates the DOM node
type that has been indexed (we also index processing instructions and
comments and could do more). We also capture any attributes as fields as
well, enabling searching on attribute values.

For the text content of the document, we are capturing only the
directly-contained content of each element and indexing that as the
"content" field. We also capture all the PCDATA content for the whole
document and index it on a separate Lucene doc with a distinct node type
(e.g., "ALL_CONTENT"). This enables phrase searching that ignores
element boundaries and can also allow for faster queries if all you care
about is whether or not a given doc has some text and not which elements
have it.

We then have a front-end that both handles preparing the queries that go
to Lucene and collating the results that come back (for example,
organizing the hits by XML document or doing additional context-based
filtering that can't be done at the Lucene level). 

Cheers,

Eliot

Hi 
As I was playing around with lucene, i saw that there is no
jsp samples using lucene.
Thus i added some jsp pages for creating an index, and searching.
I was testing using tomcat-3.2.3

As i think it might 
other users too, to start using lucene i attach a zip-file
containing the lucene jsp webapplication.

bye

I am using Lucene for a java project and am interested in using the
RAMDirectory to store the index.  I am new to Lucene and have a question
regarding the use of RAMDirectory.  Is it possible to load the RAMDirectory
index from a file or another source so as to keep from having to build the
index from scratch every time the application starts?  I like having the
index in memory, but I don't like having to rebuild the index every time I
restart the server.

Thanks,
Chris Bojrab

Thanks for the detailed information, Doug!  That helps a lot.

Based on what you've said and on taking a closer look at the code, it looks
like by setting mergeFactor and maxMergeDocs to Integer.MAX_VALUE, an entire
index will be built in a single segment completely in memory (using the
RAMDirectory) and then flushed to disk when closed.  Given enough memory, it
would seem that this would be the fastest setting (as well as using a
minimum of file handles).  Would you agree?

Thanks,
Scott

P.S. At one point I tried doing an in-memory index using the RAMDirectory
and then merging it with an on-disk index and it didn't work.  The
RAMDirectory never flushed to disk... leaving me with an empty index.  I
think this is because of a bug in the mechanism that is supposed to copy the
segments during the merge, but I didn't follow up on this.

Not quite.  This would generate an index with a segment per document in
memory, and then try to merge them all in a single step.  That should work,
but I do not think it is the most efficient way to build an index in memory.

That should work, it should be faster and would use a lot less memory than
the approach you describe above.  Can you please submit a simple test case
illustrating the failure?  Something self-contained would be best.

I think this is not possible with the current Lucene implementation yet,
but I wrote a CachingDirectory implementation which is able to cache
Directories from any source Directory. Currently a RAMCachingDirectory
(caches in RAM) and a FSCachingDirectory (caches in local file system)
exist.

I still have to do some tests before I will post them on the developers'
list, though.

Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I've set up a new white paper
along with complete source code. The new code also takes care of the new
Query subclasses PrefixQuery, RangeQuery and MultiTermQuery.

You can get the white paper (in PDF format) and source at
http://www.iq-computing.de/lucene/lucene-highlight.tar.gz
If you need US Letter format instead of A4, try
http://www.iq-computing.de/lucene/lucene-highlight-us.tar.gz

Dear Maik,

This looks fantastic - a great piece of documentation, thanks a lot!

However, when I enter a wildcard search ("wo?d" or "woo*" both cause the
error with my index), I get a NullPointerException with this trace:

java.lang.NullPointerException
 at
org.apache.lucene.search.MultiTermQuery.getQuery(MultiTermQuery.java:131)
 at misc.LuceneTools.getTermsFromMultiTermQuery(LuceneTools.java:190)
 at misc.LuceneTools.getTerms(LuceneTools.java:131)
 at misc.LuceneTools.getTermsFromBooleanQuery(LuceneTools.java:150)

 at
com.grantadesign.asm.servlet.LuceneSearchResults.doGet(LuceneSearchResults.j
ava:129)
 at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:740)

Do you ever see anything like this, as I'm a little baffled as to the
cause...

I made a tiny modification to check for enum == null in the finally block of
MultiTermQuery.getQuery(), but I get the feeling 'enum' should never be null
and that I'm doing the wrong thing...

Do you have any advice on how to get this to work?

Kind regards,

Lee Mallabone

I tested by directly creating a WildcardQuery, and it worked okay for
me.

As you can see from the trace, the exception occurs in MultiTermQuery.
As what I can see from the source, it looks like WildcardQuery.setEnum()
has not been called before. I have to admit that I don't know much about
the internals of MultiTermQuery and its subclasses, except for a basic
understanding of what they do (that is, constructing a BooleanQuery).

Ah. I'm using the queryParser, so it was slightly less obvious what queries
were created for what.

I've just done a whole bunch of code browsing/digging, and  it's as you
suspected - the WildcardQuery.prepare() method must be executed so that the
enum is set correctly. It turns out that this gets done when
Searcher.search() is called.

So I think the summary of this is that LuceneTools.getTerms() will crash if
a query containing wildcards has been parsed but not executed?

This certainly isn't the end of the world, but maybe it should be noted in
the docs?

I'd offer a code fix, but I suspect WildcardQuery.prepare() isn't public for
a good reason...

Thanks again,

Lee Mallabone.

Subject: Trying To Understand Query Syntax Details
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Spam-Rating: daedalus.apache.org 1.6.2 0/1000/N

I'm trying to understand the details of the query syntax. I found the
syntax ` in QueryParser.jj, but it doesn't make everything clear.

My initial questions:

- It doesn't appear that "?" can be the last character in a search. For
example, to match "fool" and "food", I tried to do "foo?", but got a
parse error. "fo?l" of course matches fool and foal. Is this a bug or an
implementation constraint?

- How does one specify a date range in a query? We need to be able to
search on "docs later than date x", and I know that Lucene supports date
matching, but I don't see how to specify this in a query.

Also, is there a description of the algorithm "~" uses?

Thanks,

E.

Not sure about the rest, but if you've stored your dates in yyyymmdd format,
you can use a RangeQuery like so:

dateField:[20011001-null]

This would return all dates on or after October 1, 2001.

I don't know. Maybe the tokenizer filters out numbers?
As I was working a bit more with the jsp pages, I found 
a bug, disabling the Create checkbox.
I will post the fix in the next few days. An some simple tokenizer
sample too..

When I was playing with lucene a couple of months ago, the
data for the javadoc examples was either bundled with the distro
or available separately (I don't recall exactly). I now wish
to explore the 1.2 release with the javadoc examples but cannot
find the rec.food.recipes data on the apache site. Anyone know
if that data is still available?
    Thanks, MikeB.

Subject: XML Indexing Samples
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

X-Spam-Rating: daedalus.apache.org 1.6.2 0/1000/N

I have put together a hopefully useful package that demonstrates our
current experiments with using Lucene for XML indexing. You can get the
files by anonymous ftp from che.isogen.com, /outgoing/lucene. There are
two zip files:

- lucene_xml_indexing.zip
  
  This is the core indexing code and a little Java app that lets you do
searches and see the results (including going back to the original docs
to get data not stored in the index). There is documentation that should
get you going. Also includes Jython support for interacting with the
indexer and Lucene if you don't like GUIs (I wrote the Jython first and
the the GUI, if you're wondering).

- lucene_xml_sample_index.zip

  This is a sample index containing three books from the New Testament
out of the Jon Bosak World Religions document set. I've included this
sample index because the index feature of the GUI may not work (it works
when I run the code from JBuilder, but didn't appear to work when I ran
it standalone, but I've run out of time to spend on this). The docids in
the index are absolute file paths, you need to put the "data" dir in the
Zip file at the root of the same drive you're running the GUI from. This
directory contains the original docs, which the GUI goes back to. Weak I
know but it's just a demo.

I haven't tested this stuff outside of Windows, but it should just work
elsewhere.

Let me know if there's some hideous problem with the package.

Cheers,

Eliot

Hi,

I've been testing the demo files (note that the java docs need updating)

So far the indexing on test files works ok.

Moving to HTML files:

I used the following command:

java -classpath %classpath% org.apache.lucene.IndexHTML -create .

adding ./powered.html
adding ./resources.html
Optimizing index...
1022 total milliseconds

..so far so good,

Now perform a search using command:

java -classpath %classpath% org.apache.lucene.SearchFiles

Query: Lucene
Searching for: lucene
2 total matching documents
0. null
1. null
Query:

OK so 2 total matching documents have been found, but why is 
the document path null ?

Finally a note for future ideas:

would it be possible to obtain the original postion of the found 
word in the file ?

Best regards to All

Mark

Yes, that's because PrefixQuery, WildcardQuery and
FuzzyQuery all needs to look through the index to
construct the enum that lists the terms that matches.

MultiTermQuery comes in after that to convert that
enum of terms into a BooleanQuery, which happens in
getQuery(). Thus I don't think null pointer will be
thrown if getQuery is only called after search(). 

In the meantime, I'll put in additional safeguards to
ensure that null pointer isn't thrown if search()
hasn't been called.

It's already documented. Look at the javadoc for the
MultiTermQuery class.

Yes and no. Lucene uses two query classes to handle
wildcards, namely PrefixQuery and WildcardQuery. 

To cut the long story short, PrefixQuery, the faster
of the two, is expressly optimized for wildcards
searches like "foo*" and "foa*" but doesn't yet
support single character matching like "foo?". 

WildcardQuery, the slower of the two and developed
after PrefixQuery was completed, handles general
wildcard searches like "fo*l" as well as "fo?l". 

I'll see what I can do to add single character
matching to PrefixQuery over the weekend.

Try looking at Range Query.

"~" is used to toggle fuzzy search on a single word.
Thus the search "foam~" will match with terms like
"foam", "form", "foal", "roam", etc..

I will put a revised revision of my white paper on my server regarding
Query objects that use multiple internal Query objects to represent
themselves to the outside world. This will also include RangeQuery which
you didn't mention above.

In addition to this, I've put together a new "Projekte" (=projects) area
on my site so that you can learn about the current white paper's version
more easily.

 Well, that's because IndexHTML sets field url, and not field file.
  But SearchFile tries to output the field file.
  I think IndexHTML can only be used with the jhtml sample.
  You may from the command line only the IndexFile, and SearchFile
  together, or IndeHTML, and the jhtml/html sample.

  I was having the same problems, you may try the jsp sample in
  lucene-user for sample html indexing....

I don't know. Maybe the tokenizer filters out numbers?
As I was working a bit more with the jsp pages, I found 
a bug, disabling the Create checkbox.
I will post the fix in the next few days. An some simple tokenizer
sample too..

Hi,

Try using the org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer instead
of the org.apache.lucene.analysis.StopAnalyzer in IndexFiles.java
Also in the SearchFiles.java make use of the same.
U would get search on a number

Sunil Zanjad

I developed an OracleDirectory implementation some time ago, which I
plan to post to lucene-dev in the near future.

I'm also willing to implement an SQLServerDirectory, but I haven't heard
of any demand for it. As if that weren't all, I'm having a hard time
finding a suitable (free!) JDBC driver to MS SQL Server.

--=====================_113089584==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Hi

We are trying to implement Lucene, and one of the requirements for the 
search is to provide a context within which the search term appears in a 
document. So we need something like the summary in the demo that comes with 
Lucene, except it needs to contain the context within which the search term 
is found (e.g. 50 words around the search term). The summary in the demo is 
the first X-number of characters in the HTML file.

I have a feeling we should use Filed object for that, but I am not very 
clear on how to bind a particular search term to this Field object. This 
"context" would be the context of the first occurrence of the search term 
in the document.

TermDocs interface would be an ideal candidate if it would have something 
like <document, frequency, sample_context>.

Has anyone done something similar? Any help would be appreciated.

Best regards

Is it possible to add more examples.

- I would love to see search examples using Query Primitives like Boolean,
Term etc. The <SearchFiles> example uses QueryParser. I tried and spent some
time trying to use the primitive objects in 'search' package, but could not
get the desired results. More examples would have helped a lot.
- Example to do Wild Card/Prefix/Suffix search using QueryParser. I tried a
few things and stared at code for some time. I am not sure if this is
supported. Can someone please confirm. More examples would really help.

thanks,
Harmeet

I'm very interrested to store lucene index in a database.
Currently, I use it in EJBs and I'd like to replace io access by jdbc
access.
It would be great that the jdbc solution don't required a specific database
(ie : Oracle or MSsql).
So, is there a way to have a generic JDBC solution ?

Hi,

This is something I also need to implement in the very near future. My
current thoughts are to use a variant of Maik Schreiber's way of doing
term highlighting in documents. See:
http://www.iq-computing.de/lucene/highlight.htm

Rather than highlight terms, I would just extract the first hit token,
and a certain number of characters either side of it.

This may not be the best approach, but it looks like the easiest method
to get working. I'm also not sure how realistic it will be from a
performance perspective, so if people have any alternative ideas, I'd be
happy to collaborate on an implementation...

Regards,

Hello

if you wanna indexing digit and letter mixed words just change LowerCaseTokinzer.java in com/lucene/analysis/ line 62:
      if (Character.isLetter(c)) { 
=>   if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)) { 
then the digit and letter mixed words, like "U2", "fifa98" will tokened and indexed as one word.
I think it should be default for there too much words in the world now: like "fifa98", telphone number etc.

I don't really think so. Since Lucene uses virtual "files" to store its
index, you have to use long binary data types with databases to store
them. It seems like each database uses these data types quite
differently. (Actually, it was quite difficult to write that
OracleDirectory because of Oracle's BLOB implementation.)

Hello All,

We have started using lucene recently and would like to know if lucene
supports context-sensitive summaries for the search hits? Is it possible to
store the context-sensitive summary for each term (say 200 characters
containing the search word), at the time of indexing, along with the term
and its frequency? The summary can be taken as about 100 characters before
the word and about 100 characters after the word. If the word is the first
word in the document, then 200 words after it, or if it is the last word in
the document then 200 words before it. How can it be supported for
different types of queries say phrase query, prefix query etc. Which
classes need to be edited or extended and in what manner?

An early response will be highly appreciated.
Thanks in advance for the help.

Sampreet Kaur Chawla,
Programmer.

I am wondering if it is possible to change the ordering of results from
search. Specifically, we need to sort results alphabetically by a given
field, rather then by term frequency. I assume there is a way to do this
with HitCollector, but given the warning about performance in the javadoc
I'm not sure of the best way to approach this. Any help would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom

Is there anything wrong with using multiple analyzers on the same index, =
(given of course that I am keeping the set of documents for each =
mutually exclusive)?

I am hoping to use a single Lucene index in my application, but some =
documents need to be analyzed differently.

Advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,

This should work.  The primary risk is that they generate different terms
than the analyzer you use to tokenize queries.  So long as you're aware of
that, this shouldn't be a problem.

Can you provide more details?  A common confusion is that folks try to do
format conversion in analyzers, e.g., to have different analyzers for PDF
files, for HTML files, etc.  The better approach is to implement converters
that convert these formats to plain text, either a String or a Reader.  Then
you can use the same analyzer for documents in different formats.

The best way might be the obvious way, and it's slow: to enumerate all of
the matching hits and re-sort them.  This requires a disk read for every
document.  If a query has a lot of hits, more than you intend to display,
you can end up doing a lot of extra i/o.

The only hit ordering that can be efficiently generated, besides by score,
is by document number.  Document numbers correspond to the order the
documents were added to the index.  So if you can somehow add documents to
your index alphabetically, then you can very efficiently get hits sorted
alphabetically.  Currently the best way to do this is through the low-level
HitCollector-based search API.  Just collect the highest or lowest N
document IDs.  This way you can avoid retrieving the Document objects for
hits that you don't intend to display.  I plan to add a friendlier API to
this feature when I get a chance.  Could this approach work for you?

I think this is the best approach.  Since you'll probably only be displaying
around ten hits at a time, the cost of re-tokenizing is fairly small.
Please consider contributing your code when it is complete.

The issue is that the set of features for queries on different types of
contextual units (used to define Lucene documents) will be different.

An example is that our XML and text documents need fuzzy-matching and porter
stemming capabilities and on others (created and maintained from metadata on
objects) we definitely don't want that.

We want to keep everything in one index so I believe that we need to
add/maintain/query document sets using separate IndexWriters, Readers, and
searching with disparate analyzers all on the same index.

Thanks again for the advice.

I don't think that this would be too hard.

I think a good way would be with a single table, as follows:
  CREATE TABLE LUCENE_TABLE (
    FILE_NAME   VARCHAR(100)
    START_BYTE  BIGINT
    END_BYTE    BIGINT
    DATA        VARBINARY(1024)
  )
  CREATE INDEX ON LUCENE_TABLE (FILE_NAME, START_BYTE, END_BYTE)

Using VARBINARY should make small files reasonably efficient.

Then, to find the length, use a query like:
  SELECT MAX(END_BYTE) FROM LUCENE_TABLE WHERE FILE_NAME EQUALS name

To refill a buffer with bytes from 'lo' to 'hi':
  SELECT START_BYTE,END_BYTE,DATA FROM luceneTable 
     WHERE FILE_NAME EQUALS name
     AND START_BYTE > (lo-1024)
     AND END_BYTE < (hi+1024)
Then copy the bytes from DATA into the buffer.  The logic for buffer copying
should look a lot like the logic in RAMInputStream.  Similarly, the logic
for writing buffers should look a lot like the logic in RAMOutputStream.

The Directory should be constructed with a database connection and a table
name:
  public SQLDirectory(java.sql.Connection, boolean create);

I would leave transactions out of it.  If someone wishes to have all
indexing take place within a single transaction, then they should start and
finish the transaction in application code.

Does that sound workable?

I've been experimenting with the new WildcardQuery class and since there
isn't really any documentation on its use, I've been sort of poking at it to
see how it is used.

>From what I've seen so far, you must construct the query by passing it a
Term object.  However, the String that is passed as the constructor for the
Term must end with an asterix.

Flaw 1:  if you fail to add an asterix, it throws a
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException because (presumably) an asterix can't be
found in the Term.  Wouldn't it be more useful to throw a custom Exception
that tells the user that the asterix is missing??? Just a suggestion...

Flaw 2: In the tests that I ran, I was searching for a series of
alphanumeric sequences, BD, BD-200, BD-300, etc.  (you get the idea).  When
I provided the Term "BD*", I would get all the corresponding matches except
for "BD".  Wouldn't you normally expect "BD" to be returned, along with the
other matches???

Question 1:  Has the QueryParser been updated such that it can handle
wildcard terms using the new WildcardQuery?  I.E., can it return some kind
of BooleanQuery that incorporates some terms utilizing Wildcard searches
(and others that don't)?

I have a need to index large files ( ~50,000 terms).  I noticed that by
default the maximum field length is 10,000 terms, set by IndexWriter.  How
can I index the entire content of these large files?  Obviously, one option
is to increase the maxFieldLength int to more than 10,000.  If I do this,
what are the implications?  Is there a better way?

Currently I am passing a Reader object to the "body" field and it only
indexes the first 10,000 terms.

Thanks,
Stuart

     I'm a bit preoccupied, but it's on my "to do" list.

Can somebody post some example code for using the RamDirectory class?

I just posted a second release candidate for Lucene 1.2.  This can be found
at:
  http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/release/v1.2-rc2/

If no serious bugs are found in the next few days, then I will make this the
1.2 final release.

Changes from 1.2 RC1:
 - added sources to distribution
 - removed broken build scripts and libraries from distribution
 - SegmentsReader: fixed potential race condition
 - FSDirectory: fixed so that getDirectory(xxx,true) correctly
   erases the directory contents, even when the directory
   has already been accessed in this JVM.
 - RangeQuery: Fix issue where an inclusive range query would
   include the nearest term in the index above a non-existant
   specified upper term.
 - SegmentTermEnum: Fix NullPointerException in clone() method
   when the Term is null.
 - JDK 1.1 compatibility fix: disabled lock files for JDK 1.1,
   since they rely on a feature added in JDK 1.2.

Well, we know of at least two issues:

1) RAMDirectory not merging properly (reported by me)
2) Indexes left in an inconsistent state on crash (i don't remember who
reported this)

Are these to be left as known issues for 1.2?

Thanks,
Scott

Oops... and the WildcardQuery issues that Robert Lebowitz just reported.

Hi,
I have enhanced the jsp-samples a bit more:
* select index directory
* select analyzer for creating, and searching
* added token analyzer page

i was originally developing, and testing with rc1.
i hope it helps other lucene users, so i have
attached a zip containing containing a jsp sample
webapp.
bye

Okay, I just checked in a fix for that.  Give it a try.

I thought that was fixed by the lock file support added in 1.2-RC1.  Are you
still having problems with this?

Hello all:

I'm trying to add searching for strings containing special characters,
for example, 'c++'. I'm currently using StandardAnalyzer and the
'+' character is being ignored. Is there any way of doing this?

Thanks,
Ravi.

Hi, just wanted to let you know that I have put up version 1.1 of my
term highlighting white paper on my server.
This new version includes a special note about multi-term or "compound"
Query objects.

  Hi,

  >Indexes left in an inconsistent state on crash (i don't
  > remember who

  I believe that even I have reported it. This happens on abrupt exit of the
JVM
  To do this I had one thread updating a directory containing many .txt
files and
  I simply exited the program. Later when I ran the search, it didnt give me
the
  desired output. I know the type of testing is for extreme rare event in
event of
  power failure or application crash, etc...
  Is it possible that Lucene would have in future, this kind of rollback
ready ?
  I am surely looking forward to have some feedback on this issue.

  Regards,
  Sunil Zanjad

*This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro*
I just had that problem as well. I got around it by writing my own
Analyzer and Tokenizer. I called the Tokenizer WhitespaceTokenizer and
it basically delimits tokens based on whitespace instead of the default
Character.isLetter(ch). There is a test: Character.isWhitespace(ch) that
I used instead of the isLetter. Then the Analyzer was just like the default
only it used my WhitespaceTokenzier.

This does however present some other problems like punctuation. You don't
really want each word at the end of a sentence being tokenzied with the
period attached, but that's just something to add to the Tokenzier code.

I'm still in testing phases, but when I get a complete solution I'll post
the
code. Hope that helps!

Jonathan

You may want to consider using different fields for the indexed text of these different types of documents. Then when you query one field you'll know to use one analyzer and when you query another - use another. Still the same index. This way, you will be explicit about what type of terms you are trying to find in what type of document. The same query could include expressions for both fields (you may have to do this in the API in order to analyze query terms for each of these properly).

Hmm.. are you certain that WildcardQuery is used? If
you are using QueryParser, then Terms ending with an
asterix are handled by PrefixQuery and not
WildcardQuery. 

Although I think WildcardQuery possibly could be used
with terms ending with asterix, it was never tested
this way as it is assumed that PrefixQuery would
handle such cases.

Yes.

Has anyone tried implimenting 3rd party open source
utilities to do this?  xpdf (www.foolabs.com/xpdf)
converts pdf to text and catdoc
(http://www.ice.ru/~vitus/catdoc/ver-0.9.html)
converts ms word to text.  Maybe these can be used to
create the plain text for the index...

I look forward to seeing PDF and Word indexing added
to this solution.

My Best;

J

Hi all,

I am new to lucene and I can not understand why I am getting following error
with this program?

public class Search {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

	try{
    String indexPath = "d:\\org", queryString = "parag";

    Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexPath);
    Query query = QueryParser.parse(queryString, "body",
                              new SimpleAnalyzer());
    Hits hits = searcher.search(query);

    for (int i=0; i<hits.length(); i++) {
      System.out.println(hits.doc(i).get("path") + "; Score: " +
                         hits.score(i));
    	}
	}
	catch(Exception e)
	{
		System.out.println(e.getMessage());
	}
  }
}

ERROR: the error I am getting is that it throws IOException saying that can
not find org directory in D: (which is there with a file).
Can anybody help me? So that I can read a file from directory and search
with given criterion.

Thanx in advance,

Regards
parag

     Hm, are you sure it should be two slashes?  Alternately, try using
forward-slashes (java will map // to whatever your system uses, but not
necessarily \\).

That's actually the correct behavior.  If indexing is not completed, with a
call to IndexWriter.close(), then the index should appear unchanged.

Two back-slashes is correct, the first being the Java escape character.

Should the path passed to IndexSearcher have a trailing back-slash?

i.e. 

public class Search {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try{
      String indexPath = "d:\\org\\", queryString = "parag";
      Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexPath);

I'm trying to implement this and should be able to contribute any
succesful results, but I need to produce context on a per-field basis.
Eg. if I got a token hit in the text body of a document, but the first
hit token was a word in the section title, I'd want to generate context
around the token in the text body.

I had been using a TokenStream to try this. However, lucene's Token
class doesn't seem to have any concept of fields, (even when I
tokenStream() a document that is in the index with a whole bunch of
fields). Is there any reason for this? Moreover, any suggestions of how
to find the information I need?

The natural thing seems to be to have a field-aware token stream, but
I'm not sure how I'd go about implementing that...

How did the title ever get indexed as the title?  Presumably you split the
document into fields when it was indexed.  Similarly, if you re-tokenize
things a field at a time then you should always know which field you are in,
no?

But what happens to those files which I have indexed successfully earlier?
The search wouldnt retrieve results of the previous indexed files.
Is this state correct?
Please do clarify on this.

Hi,

Except for the import part U have stated everything properly in your source
code.
I tried it out and it works fine.
Hence just check whether the org directory is actually present in the 'D'
drive itself,
and not on some other drive.
I believe that this would surely solve your problem.
Contact me if U wish, I am just a few cubics away...

Regards,

Sunil Zanjad

Hi all,

I am new to lucene and I can not understand why I am getting following error
with this program?

public class Search {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

	try{
    String indexPath = "d:\\org", queryString = "parag";

    Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexPath);
    Query query = QueryParser.parse(queryString, "body",
                              new StandardAnalyzer());
    Hits hits = searcher.search(query);

    for (int i=0; i<hits.length(); i++) {
      System.out.println(hits.doc(i).get("path") + "; Score: " +
                         hits.score(i));
    	}
	}
	catch(Exception e)
	{
		System.out.println(e.getMessage());
	}
  }
}

ERROR: the error I am getting is that it throws IOException saying that can
not find org directory in D: (which is there with a file).
Can anybody help me? So that I can read a file from directory and search
with given criterion.

Thanx in advance,

Regards
parag

If you think there is a bug, can you please provide a simple,
self-contained, reproducible test case that illustrates the problem.  You
could use Runtime.getRuntime().halt() to abruptly exit the JVM.

Hi,

Two weeks back I did have the problem which I stated.
But I am unable to reproduce the results currently. I tested and retested
but couldnt repeat the same.
Doug have U guys fixed the issue long back itself ?
(The only thing I have done fresh is to download the latest
lucene-1.2-rc1.zip file and re-installed lucene  - since it came along with
source code)

:-)

Regards,

Sunil Zanjad

     Hm, well, maybe, maybe not.  Why not avoid guessing and use
either "/" (which java will convert into \ if you're on a windows
system) or File.separator (which is the "right" way to do it, but can
get kind of awkward)?
 
> Should the path passed to IndexSearcher have a trailing back-slash?

     I don't think so, but I've been away from that bit of my code
for a few weeks (and it's not handy to look at the moment).

>       String indexPath = "d:\\org\\", queryString = "parag";

     One gotcha I've run into several times wtih file paths is making
sure that the file path works from the command line.  Specifically,
obviously you should make sure that the file path as given works from
your command line.  However, I've also run into gotchas where I was
checking by loading the filepath in my editor, and the editor expanded
the filepath for me, where the java application didn't :-).

     I believe what Sunil was trying to describe was:

a) sucessfully created index
b) did searches on index
c) started to update index
d) clicked "exit" from app before updating completed
e) ran app again 
f) could not repeat searches from step b.

     Doug has recently mentioned several improvements in the past
month or so.  I'm looking forward to moving over to the new version,
which is among other things thread safe.  This sounds like the area
where you were probably having problems, which means it's likely that
Doug's changes fixed it.

     This is, by the way, why it's important to report problems
early, ideally along with test data and code to reproduce it, or at
least detailed descriptions of how to reproduce it...

I'm indexing HTML documents marked up with comments to indicate field
boundaries. So I'd typically have:

<!--field:section_title-->
blurb
<!--field:text-->
more blurb

and so on. The documents were indexed by looking for each field marker
and then adding the subsequent lines to the relevant field.

In order to obtain a generic solution for context generation are you
suggesting I write a method that takes plain text, (eg, text form of
document) and a query, and assumes the plain text is in the query's
default field?

This doesn't seem quite as useful as getContext(Hashset queryTerms,
Reader originalDocument); which is what I was originally aiming towards.

En blancoI=B4m trying to implement Lucene in my application but I=B4m =
really a newbie.

1) If I want to create a Index in the directory e:\Lucene, must I just =
do writer =3D new IndexWriter("E:/Lucene", null, true); ?

2) How exactly can I create a Index in a database ? Can anybody send a =
sample ?

3) Talking about the boolean third parameter in IndexWriter if I write =
writer =3D new IndexWriter("E:/Lucene", null, false); and the index dont =
exist.. is the Index created anyway ?
(I must use it to control if the index is already writed or not)

Thanks a lot !!!=20

Thanks, Doug.  That did fix my merge problem.

As for the inconsistent state on crash bug: I had thought that there might
still be a problem given another poster's comments, but I see from remainder
of this thread that there is probably no remaining issue here.

If you're doing application-specific processing to extract fields from
documents, then a completely generic solution for extracting hit context
from documents is, by definition, impossible, since context extraction
requires field extraction.

I'm not exactly sure what you're proposing here, but, no, it doesn't sound
like something that I have suggested.

Such a method is easy to define if the Reader contains text from a single
field.  (Although you should probably pass in an Analyzer too.)  However if
you're expecting such a method to automatically divide the text into fields,
then things will be harder, since Lucene's model is that applications divide
documents into fields.  So you could write an application-specific version
that divides fields automatically, or, to use more generic code, you could
call such a generic method once for each field of your document, leaving
field extraction in application-specific code.  Does that make sense?

Hi,
Does anyone know if there is a way to use a proximity operator (like 
near or within) in the lucene engine?
For example, if you want to know that microsoft is within 3 words of ibm 
you could use
microsoft n3 ibm

If not, how difficult is this to add the the indexing and searching 
system?

Any thanks would be appreciated.

Hi,

I have implemented search on my website using lucene. However, I still have
a few questions -- mostly because of the flexible nature of Lucene. I would
like to learn from users who have some real world experience.

My situation: English documents. Three searchable 'fields' per document --
reference id, short description and content.

* Analyzer
-----------
I am using a combination of Standard, LowerCase, Stop and PorterStem
tokenizers. Is this the preferred combo or is there anything better?

* Query
-----------
Right now I am directly using the query parser. However, I am uncertain as
to whether this is the best approach especially with the myraid of Query
classes (Fuzzy, Wildcard, etc.). I would like to set up 'internal' boost
factors i.e maybe description is twice as important as content, etc. but
don't want users to enter the boost factors in the query itself. Any
experience shared will be greatly appreciated.

BTW, what is a Fuzzy Query?

* Ranking
------------
I've read the FAQ on generating the "stars" but am still a bit confused. For
example, searching a 2 page document that has about 7 or 8 'email' in it the
score is 0.07. Now I would've thought that this is a 4 star at least (if not
a 5) kind of search. In fact, I rarely get a 0.8+ score. I am aware that teh
score depends on the total number of words as well and that makes it even
more confusing on how to design a 'starring' strategy.

* General
------------
* Has anybody implemented aliasing yet? If yes, can you please point me to
it?

* My search is going to be used by businesses and I read some artciles that
said that organizing search results by "topics" is preferred very greatly.
E.g. if the word 'penguin' is searched then it would be a bit useless to
show sites related to arctic life, with linux, with research site on
penguins, with the hockey team site, etc. on the same page. Better would be
to organize these results. This of course is a very stupid example that can
be sorted out by adding more keywords, but in business scenarios this may
not be easy. Has anybody ventured into this? Any pointers will be useful.

Thanks much in advance
-Nikhil

There's a control variable called slop in PhraseQuery that performs what you
desire. By default, slop is set to 0 so that only exact phrases will match.
However, you can alter the value using the setSlop() method, eg setSlop(3)
to get the effect you desire.

We are trying to "de-value" documents which contain certain terms.  So
instead of increasing the value of those documents and thus moving them to
the top of the list, we are trying to decrease the value and hopefully move
those documents to the bottom of the list.  To do this we are playing with
various combinations of setBoost(...).  Thinking here, is that to de-value
we would set a lower boost value, increase value we would set a higher boost
value, and neutral would be a boost value in the middle:

final TermQuery
  retval = new TermQuery(new Term(field, value));

retval.setBoost(
  preference < 0
    ? 0.0f
    : preference > 0
      ? 100000.0f
      : 50000.0f
);

However, no matter what "negative" boost we set, the mere fact that the
terms of the document have matched with the query moves the document to the
top of the list.  Here is the query that is being generated:

GLOBAL_MATCH:GLOBAL_VALUE^50000.0 +(424:6^50000.0 424:7^50000.0
424:8^50000.0 424:9^50000.0 424:10^50000.0 424:11^50000.0 424:12^50000.0
424:13^50000.0 424:14^50000.0 424:15^50000.0 424:16^50000.0 424:17^50000.0
424:18^50000.0) (424:14^0.0 423:Natalie Imbruglia - Torn Music Video^0.0
422:600^0.0 422:476^0.0 422:586^0.0 422:419^0.0) +(contentTypeId:1
contentTypeId:4)

Notice that some terms have a boost of 0.0 while others have a boost of
50000.0 yet, the document with boost of 0.0 still appears on top.

Could someone recommend a way of doing a "negative" boost?

Thanks.

Okay, I'm now not entirely certain how useful a generic solution will be
to me, given the non-generic nature of the content I'm indexing. I think
there a lot of optomizations I can make that wouldn't be generic.

I'll play around and see what I come up with - if anything turns out to
look sufficiently generic that it might be useful, I'll post it to the
list.

Thanks for your thoughts,

Hi, I'm having some problems with segments failing to merge when deleting
documents from the index. I've followed the recommendations in the FAQ for
avoiding a complete index rebuild when adding a new document, i.e. I'm
deleting the document from the index and the re-adding it. The index however
is growing even if I just replace the same document repeatedly. And although
the reader.numDocs() method returns the correct value the reader.docFreq()
for each term is increasing.

I'd appreciate any help. Thanks.

When I index a document, I have this code:

// check if it's already there and if it is, delete it
fsd = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexPath, false);
reader = IndexReader.open(fsd);
Term t = new Term("original_path", f.getPath());
if (reader.delete(t) > 0) {
	out.println("This file was already in the index, replacing it.<br>");
}

// add document to index
writer = new IndexWriter(indexPath, new MyAnalyzer(), false);
Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(Field.Keyword("original_path", f.getPath()));
doc.add(Field.Text("filename", f.getName()));
doc.add(Field.Text("description", "a description"));
writer.addDocument(doc);

// clean up
fsd.close();
reader.close();
writer.close();

I then have a class to examine the documents in the index. When I first add
a document it appears correctly, however as I re-add (delete then add
documents as above), the reader.isDeleted() flag remains set for each of the
re-added documents which would be ok assuming segments have not been merged
yet but the re-added documents do not appear anywhere in the
reader.documents(i) collection. The code to examine is as follows:

fsd = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexPath, false);
reader = IndexReader.open(fsd);

// show document details
for (int i = 0; i < reader.numDocs(); i ++) {
	if (!reader.isDeleted(i)) {
		Document d = reader.document(i);
		for (Enumeration e = d.fields(); e.hasMoreElements() ;) {
			Field f = (Field) e.nextElement();
			out.println(f.toString() + ": " + f.name() + "=" + f.stringValue() +
"<br>");
		}
	}
}

// clean up
fsd.close();
reader.close();
writer.close();

There is a bug in the demonstration documentation.

It says to search use the following

 > java -cp lucene.jar:demo/classes 
org.apache.lucene.IndexFilesSearchFiles

It should read

java -cp lucene.jar:demo/classes org.apache.lucene.SearchFiles

I hope this helps.

Alex,

Can you please supply a simple reproducible example?  When I set the boost
for a term to zero then documents containing it do not come to the top.  Nor
do they go to the bottom.  The boost is multiplied into the weight for the
term, but the weights are then added into the document score, so a zero
boost will have little effect on the final ranking.

Lucene does not currently support negative boosts, which might achieve what
you want.  I just made the modifications to required to support negative
boosts.  Please find these attached and tell me how they work.  If they work
then I will check them in after the 1.2 release is final.

Doug

Doug the changes you have sent work GREAT in my case.

Thanks
Alex Paransky

PS:

1. I was not able to use patch 2.5 to incorporate the .diff file you sent
me, so my changes were done by hand.  I double checked the final diff
against what you send me and they are the same.  I am not too familiar with
the patch program so if there are any options I need to use please tell me.
Here is the patch session from my machine:

C:\work\individualnetwork\external\lucene-1.2-rc1-fix>"\Program
Files\GNU\WinCvs 1.2\patch" -i c:\diffs.dat
patching file `src/java/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.jj'
Assertion failed: hunk, file patch.c, line 321

abnormal program termination

2. Another minor addition would be to make Query and Terms implement a
java.io.Serializable.  We are currently in a process of incorporating Lucene
into an EJB application, and we have a Statefull Session Bean object called
SearchResults which should accept a Query and search the collection
(SearchResults basically wraps IndexSearcher), however, because Query/Term
is not Serialiable, we are forced to execute .toString() and then attempt to
use a parser to rebuild the result.  The problem with this is that parser
does not offer the type of flexibility that we can get from directly
buidling Query/Term structures (for example, some of the values have spaces
in them, so the parser sees field:value1 value2 value3 and does not
correctly interpret this as field:"term(value1) term(value2) term(value3)",
however if we use quotes, we get a PhraseQuery instead of TermQuery we are
looking for).  Should this be an enhancement that I should mention in the
bugzilla, or would this e-mail suffice?

Again, thanks for your help.

There's a control variable called slop in PhraseQuery that performs what you
desire. By default, slop is set to 0 so that only exact phrases will match.
However, you can alter the value using the setSlop() method, eg setSlop(3)
to get the effect you desire.

Hi all,

I have written the code which gives me the url of searched results and that
url I am converting to the anchors. But the the problem is after clicking on
the link, I should be able to go and open the file it is referring, but
instead of that I am getting error as "Page can not be found".

My code is:
        <%
                /**
                **search is the instance of the bean that I am using and
startSearch returns me a vector filed up with path of hits
                */

search.init();
                Vector
v1=search.startSearch("\\disscusion_forum","formname");

                for(int i=0;i<v1.size();i++){
                        try{
                                String item=((String)v1.elementAt(i));
                                out.println("val: "+item);
                                URL u=new URL("http",null,item);
                                String url=u.toString();
                                out.println("<a href="+item+">"+url+"</a>");
                        }catch (Exception e){
                                out.println("Error in forming URL");
                                out.println(e.getMessage());
                                }
                }
        %>

I should be able to open files return from the search.

Can anybody help me?
Thanx in advance.

I'm not sure if this is the cause of your problems, but when you're doing
deletions you need to close the reader before you open a writer, otherwise
deletions can be lost.  You're claiming that additions are lost, but could
it really be that it is the deletions which have been lost?  Try closing the
reader before you open the writer and tell me if that helps.

Doug

Hi

Looking at the Apache source code download page 
(http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sourceindex.html), there isn't seem to be 
Lucene download. Can someone provide me with the URL to Lucene 1.2-RC1?

Thanks for your response.

I tried closing the reader before opening the writer with no change, the
index still grows and doesn't merge.

I think an important point here might be that I'm adding/re-adding documents
in bulk, i.e. I iterate through files in a directory adding each document in
turn according to the code in my previous e-mail. I tried adding
reader.optimize() after writer.addDocument() with no effect however if I
open a new reader after all the documents have been added and then call
.optimize() as below the index merges correctly. I.e. the following code is
called after all documents have been added. Why does .optimize() work in
this location but not when I optmize after adding each document?

// optimize the index
FSDirectory fsd = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexPath, false);
IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(fsd, new MyAnalyzer(), false);
writer.optimize();
writer.close();

Thanks,
Matt.

I'm not sure if this is the cause of your problems, but when you're doing
deletions you need to close the reader before you open a writer, otherwise
deletions can be lost.  You're claiming that additions are lost, but could
it really be that it is the deletions which have been lost?  Try closing the
reader before you open the writer and tell me if that helps.

     "Early optimization is the root of all evil."  

     Seriously, though, one thing I see Doug say often is that
lucene's indexing and searching are designed to be extremely fast.  He
often responds to questions about odd details - for example, the
classic "do a search and cache the search results for paging across
multiple web pages" - by saying to just use the brute force approach
and rely on the speed of the lucene index.  

     I like to say, I assume that there are people out there with a
lot more on the ball than me about things like optimization.  I try to
use their brains as much as possible :-).  For example, with
compilers, I assume the compiler writer knew a lot more about
optimization than I do.  People talk about the compiler not having the
human judgement to know what's best.  That's true, but the way to deal
with that is not to try to hand-optimize my code and outguess the
compiler (which will only will only confuse the compiler and prevent
it from doing what it was designed to do).  The compiler can best
optimize the program if I focus on making it clear what my intent is,
what the program is meant to do, in the structure of the code first.

     This leads to another optimization slogan that I remember reading
- algorithmic optimization is much better than spot optimization.  In
other words, before you try to figure out a faster way to do
something, figure out if you're doing the thing that accomplishes your
true goal in the fastest way.  And figure out how important that thing
is in the grand scheme of things.

Can you show the values of item and url?  Are those correctly retrieved?
Also you are missing an extra set of quotes around the item.  The proper
syntax is:

<a href="URL">string</a>

Note the there are quotes around the URL...  You need something like this:
out.println("<a href=\""+item+"\">"+url+"</a>");

There is not enough information to diagnose the problem...

Hi all,

I have written the code which gives me the url of searched results and that
url I am converting to the anchors. But the the problem is after clicking on
the link, I should be able to go and open the file it is referring, but
instead of that I am getting error as "Page can not be found".

My code is:
        <%
                /**
                **search is the instance of the bean that I am using and
startSearch returns me a vector filed up with path of hits
                */

search.init();
                Vector
v1=search.startSearch("\\disscusion_forum","formname");

                for(int i=0;i<v1.size();i++){
                        try{
                                String item=((String)v1.elementAt(i));
                                out.println("val: "+item);
                                URL u=new URL("http",null,item);
                                String url=u.toString();
                                out.println("<a href="+item+">"+url+"</a>");
                        }catch (Exception e){
                                out.println("Error in forming URL");
                                out.println(e.getMessage());
                                }
                }
        %>

I should be able to open files return from the search.

Can anybody help me?
Thanx in advance.

Since Lucene is written in Java, shouldn't it be possible to use the Unicode
equivalents of these characters to index and search???

I haven't done any work yet with Internationalization in Lucene, but I'm
assuming it should work with many languages.

Hi all,

In Indexing, generally when you index a text file 
containing a word say

"Categories"

the index will create a set of files. *.fnm,*.fdt etc.,
If we open the file *.tis we can see the word 

"categories"

I mean the file *.tis contains all the indexed words 
in their true characters.

when I used the following words

"catgories"

the index files are created but when I opened the *.tis,
it containes 

"catgories"  

This shows the word is converted during indexing. Then
now we can't able to search the original word. Why it is 
happened like this ? What modification is needed to
correct this ? Which Side changes required, I mean in
"Index" side or "Search" side.

with regards
Srini

Hi all,

I am facing one problem with Lucene search.
My code is perfectly working fine on my local machine but when I try to run
the sane code on the Tomacat-Jakarta (version 3.2.3) then it gives me the
FileNotFoundException for the directory I am trying to search.

I have copied the directory structure under the root in the tomcat server
and lucene jar file to the lib of server.

I guess , I missing some kind of settings required for the server.

Can anybody help me on this issue???

Regards
parag

Matt,
 I'm also having this problem.  In my application I may get an update for a
document in the index that needs to be added.  I delete the existing
document, add the new document with the changes, and if you try to search
for it, you can't find it.  *Sometimes* if you get another document that
needs changing and add it, the previously changed document will then show
up, but not the one you just added.  This makes me think that it's an open
file problem.  I've check all of my code, and that doesn't appear to be the
case.  I also did the "open and optimize" trick, and it makes all updates
available for me as well.  However, I may get a group of twenty or so
updates in one group (although my program can't see they are in a group, it
only sees the individual "add document" events) which means that I must
optimize after each addition to the index.  This gets expensive.   I'm
continuing to investigate this, and would appreciate you passing on anything
you find.


Cheers,

Tom Eskridge

Sounds very similar to my problem, however I've found adequate work arounds
for my system as follows, I don't know whether it'll help you out at all.
Obviously a better solution would be to have more control or at least
information about how Lucene decides to schedule segment merges and the
behaviour of deleted documents. Anyone able to do this?

When I do bulk "delete/adds", (i.e. when I'm iterating through files in a
filesystem directory and replacing existing index entries with updated
ones), at the end of all the delete/adds I ensure all readers and writers
are closed and open a new writer and then writer.optimize(). This always has
the effect of merging all segments of the index - however it didn't work
when I placed it after each .addDocument() call, possibly because I would
need to close and reopen the writer, but I never tried that.

When I'm updating individual entries one at a time my experience differs
from yours. I call writer.optimize() immediately after the call to
writer.addDocument() and it appears to correctly merge segments every time.
I have no idea why this would work for individual delete/adds but not when
doing them in bulk and I'd imagine I'll have problems in a multi-user
environment.

Matt.

One way to have more meaningful "stars" would be to use a scale factor
that will be applied to the scores before you decide how many stars to
display.

As an example, all scores could be scaled such that the document with
the highest score will get 100% (and thus gets 5 stars):


	float scaleFactor = hits.score(0);
	float currentDocumentScore;

	while (i = 0; i < hits.length(); i++)
	{
		currentDocumentScore = hits.score(i) * scaleFactor;

		// calculate number of "stars" here

		// do something with hits.doc(i)
	}

Sorry. That should of course read:

	float scaleFactor = 100f / hits.score(0);

It works... The mailing list has been moved off to a new server, and
apparently, everything works as predicted. Let me know of any problems.

As you might have noticed, one-by-one, all mailing lists for
Jakarta.Apache.ORG have been moved off to a new server, to
split the load of all Apache Mailing Lists on two separate
machines.

What does it mean? In theory that mail are going to be processed
faster, and that we should not fall back into another backlog like
the one which affected us last week.

I am not directly subscribed to each one of these mailing lists,
so, if you have problems, you can simply report them to the owner
at <lucene-user-owner@jakarta.apache.org> to the
webmaster <webmaster@jakarta.apache.org>, or to me directly.

Thanks to Brian Behlendorf for his incredible help and support,
and to a bunch of people who helped out to make this happen.
Sorry for the quite huge amount of test messages I sent out
(especially this one: it's goint to all lists all together, and
it's intended to be also a load test) but I want to make sure that
everything is working correctly...

And now let's hope everything is right :) :) :)

    Pier (keeping his fingers crossed)

    Hello! I've been trying Lucene during some time, and
I like it, it seems to be pretty good. I'm trying to do a
Web searcher (similar to WebSearch) but I'm in a trouble.
If I want to seach exactly "" in a Lucene app, running it in
a Command Line (like demo/SearchFiles) it throws an exception:

Exception in thread "main" com.lucene.queryParser.TokenMgrError: Lexical
error a
t line 1, column 2.  Encountered: <EOF> after : ""

in the other hand, if I try the same from a WebApp (like WebSearch) it
doesn't throw it.
I' ve been "playing" with Character Encodings and Locale Configs, but I
didn't obtain anything.
Can someone help me?

Thanks.

I couldn't find help in the FAQ or in the code.

When is using fuzzy query (over the other knows queries) appropriate?

Thanks.

Has anybody gotten the following exception when trying to search an index
with a large number of files (>2000)?

mmg.svc.lucene.LuceneIndex.searchKeywords(LuceneIndex.java:119)

As you can see I am using the RAMDirectory as the storage for my index.  The
following code is used to search the index for the keyword provided:

            Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(m_index);   
            Analyzer analyzer = new StopAnalyzer();
            Query query = QueryParser.parse(exp, IndexedFile.KEYWORD_FIELD,
analyzer);
            Hits hits = searcher.search(query);

The exception is thrown from the Searcher.search() method.  I did a little
bit of research and found that in the RAMInputStream.readInternal() method
it is trying to read (6218 - 1024) bytes from the second buffer in the
RAMFile object.  Well the buffer size is only 1024 so the exception is
thrown.  It looks like it was assumed that any RAMFile object will have at
most 2 buffers (ie. max 2048 bytes).  Another peculiar piece of information
is that that 6218 number just so happens to be the exact number of files
that I indexed.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I am using the StandardAnalyzer for both indexing and QueryParser.  If I
index the following text:  "Massachusetts"
 
The following query finds the document: "mass*"
 
But if I use this query then the document is not found: "Mass*"
 
Is this the expected behavior or am I doing something wrong?
 
Also, what is the difference between a prefix query and wildcard query?
What is the query syntax for a wildcard query?  Does the StandardAnalyzer
support WildcardQuery?
 
Note:  I'm using Lucene 1.2 RC2
 
Thanks.

Anyone know how to filter pre result sets with a minimum score?

lets say i search for cars and it returns me back 100 total matched results
where my returned rows = 10 and start index = 0.

currently by default lucene sorts the results based on the hit score.
however is there a way to set the minimum hit score pre search?

so hypothetically for my car search say 50 of the 100 meet the score...then

my new result set should just return 50 total matched results while keeping
intact the returned rows 10 and start index = 0.  

if we do post rendering of these hit scores then there is no way we nkow th
total match result number.

just wondering if anyone knows a way to set min hit score or a clean hack
around it.  thanks!!!

That looks like a bug.  I guess folks have not built large RAM-based indexes
much.  I know I haven't.

Try replacing the definition of RAMInputStream.readInternal() with:

  public final void readInternal(byte[] dest, int destOffset, int len) {
    int remainder = len;
    int start = pointer;
    while (remainder != 0) {
      int bufferNumber = start/InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE;
      int bufferOffset = start%InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE;
      int bytesInBuffer = InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE - bufferOffset;
      int bytesToCopy = bytesInBuffer >= remainder ? remainder :
bytesInBuffer;
      byte[] buffer = (byte[])file.buffers.elementAt(bufferNumber);
      System.arraycopy(buffer, bufferOffset, dest, destOffset, bytesToCopy);
      destOffset += bytesToCopy;
      start += bytesToCopy;
      remainder -= bytesToCopy;
    }
    pointer += len;
  }

Tell me whether this fixes things for you.

You can do this using the low-level HitCollector-based search API.

That said, I do not recommend it.  It will not make things much more
efficient.

Lucene's scores are not really that meaningful on an absolute scale: they're
only meaningful relative to other scores for the same query.  So you're best
off just displaying the highest scoring hits.  Lucene does things behind the
scenes to make this efficient.

Yes, prefix queries are indeed case sensitive.  The problem is that prefixes
do not go through an analyzer, which is where lower-casing is done.  The
reason is that if you were searching for "dogs*" you would not want "dogs"
first stemmed to "dog", since that would then match "dog*", which is not the
intended query.  A workaround for this is simply to lowercase the entire
query before passing it into the query parser.

Hello Doug,

where can I obtain the low-level hitcollector api? is it part of lucene?  I
agree with you on the abstractness of those scores though, I just wanna play
around with that filtering though.  thanks.

Subject: RE: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception with >2000 files


That looks like a bug.  I guess folks have not built large RAM-based indexes
much.  I know I haven't.

Try replacing the definition of RAMInputStream.readInternal() with:

  public final void readInternal(byte[] dest, int destOffset, int len) {
    int remainder = len;
    int start = pointer;
    while (remainder != 0) {
      int bufferNumber = start/InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE;
      int bufferOffset = start%InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE;
      int bytesInBuffer = InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE - bufferOffset;
      int bytesToCopy = bytesInBuffer >= remainder ? remainder :
bytesInBuffer;
      byte[] buffer = (byte[])file.buffers.elementAt(bufferNumber);
      System.arraycopy(buffer, bufferOffset, dest, destOffset, bytesToCopy);
      destOffset += bytesToCopy;
      start += bytesToCopy;
      remainder -= bytesToCopy;
    }
    pointer += len;
  }

Tell me whether this fixes things for you.

I'm thinking of producing some neat new services built upon Lucene.

One thing I need is an alert function, that is, instead of searching
with a query on a lot of documents, I want all incoming documents to be
searched against a bunch of stored search queries (called "agents").

The simple solution is to index the document and then iterate through
all agents, but that isn't very scalable (say there are 10 new documents
a minute, and 10000 stored agents...).

The way commercial products like Verity and Autonomy handles this is to
store the search queries (the agents) instead, and then use the incoming
document as a search query against the stored agents. This way it
becomes extremely scalable.

Could this be a solution with Lucene too, and how would that look like?

I don't know if my message I'd sent to lucene-user, was delivered to you,
because I got a mailer daemon failure message.
If not, pls forward it to the lucene user list.

Hello,
this is the same problem that Joanne highlighted on dev list. (had problem
with Finnish characters)

I think it's the bug of QueryParser.jj file because there the term is
definied as character string that begins with any English character.

Modify a line in the QueryParser.jj:
orig line:
<TERM:      <_IDENTIFIER_CHAR>
              ( ~["\"", " ", "\t", "(", ")", ":", "&", "|", "^", "*",
"?", "~", "{", "}", "[", "]" ] )* >

modified:
<TERM:   ( ~["\"", " ", "\t", "(", ")", ":", "&", "|", "^", "*", "?",
"~", "{", "}", "[", "]" ] )+ >

And rebuild the package. I managed to search "".

Its a problem with the query parser, but this is not the correct fix.
I think this fix just masks the problem.

Hi,

  I have a field which I need to match exactly -- Ideally it shouldn't 
even be tokenized, but I can't find a way to do that -- adding a 
field that is indexed but not tokenized, doesn't seem to work -- or 
at least a Term Query doesn't work.

  eg the field is "x y z" -- and I do a phrase query "x y" it should 
not match -- just "x y z" should match.
 
Cheers,
  Winton

Hi,

(Apologies if this shows up twice). 

If I do a search such as "field1:jim OR field2:bob" is there any way to
determine for each document that was a hit, which field caused the hit?

Or rather, since they both might, is there any easy way to find out
which fields definitely didn't cause a hit?

Regards,

This should work.  You should be able to find an un-tokenized field
containing spaces with a TermQuery.  Nothing should ever tokenize the
string.

Can you please supply a simple, self-contained example showing that this
does not work?

Thanks,

Doug

Hi,
I am new user, I would truly appreciate if someone
could tell me where I can find a Tutorial or
Documentation for Lucene which will guide me through
how to get started and do a simple search test.

Thank You,

Haven't seen any really simple tutorials since I've been using it. The best
place to start though is the FAQ at
http://www.lucene.com/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi . I read completely through
it several times and was finally able to start making progress. Then you may
want to look through the demo application thoroughly and read up on the API
docs.

I know it's not a very user friendly study, but it's the best that I could
find out there at the current time. Perhaps someone will start to develop a
tutorial for the product?

Hello,

I have some trouble understanding the semantics of the BooleanQuery with
regards to prohibited clause.


the method I am using is this:

public final void add(Query query, boolean required, boolean prohibited)

in the class BooleanQuery.


I am not using the QueryParser, but instead I build my own queries from a
Tree of search-strings with boolean operators NOT, AND and OR

so a tree might look like this

	 AND
	/   \
    "A"   NOT
           |
          "B"

and that would mean "documents containing A, but not B". (If the AND was an
OR, the NOT branch would be culled)


Now my problem is this, when I make a BooleanQuery containing only a
prohibited TermQuery and I add that to another BooleanQuery as a required
query, I always get 0 results.


here's an example of my code:
---------------------------
        Term term1 = new Term("name", "jensen");
        Term term2 = new Term("name", "barfod");

        BooleanQuery minusQuery = new BooleanQuery();
        minusQuery.add(new TermQuery(term2), false, true);

        BooleanQuery q1 = new BooleanQuery();
        q1.add(new TermQuery(term1), true, false);
        q1.add(minusQuery, false, false);    // not required that the
minusQuery is "matched"

        BooleanQuery q2 = new BooleanQuery();
        q2.add(new TermQuery(term1), true, false);
        q2.add(minusQuery, true, false);     // required that the minusQuery
is "matched"

        BooleanQuery q3 = new BooleanQuery();
        q3.add(new TermQuery(term1), true, false);
        q3.add(new TermQuery(term2), false, true); // add the term directly
as a prohibited query

        System.out.println("non-required: " + _index.search(q1,
null).length());
        System.out.println("required    : " + _index.search(q2,
null).length());
	  System.out.println("directly    : " + _index.search(q3, null).length());
---------------------------

this outputs:

non-required: 55
required    : 0
directly    : 48

Anders Nielsen

I had the same problem and have started to write down all my own notes 
and experiences. I was hoping this could be put into a manual/tutorial 
in the future.
I was going to wait until it was a bit more robust, but let's see if we 
can create some coordination.

Is anyone else out there creating a tutorial. I would be willing to 
compile and coordinate all the different parts for the people who want 
to contribute.

If there is already an effort going on, lets make sure everyone knows 
about it, if not please email me if you are willing to work on a part of 
the manual.

Thanks

--Peter

Are brackets, [ and ], legal in a query?  
If so, do they have some special meaning?
If not, are there other "illegal" characters as well?

Parsing the query syntax, "[]", causes the following error:

Lexical error at line 1, column 3.  Encountered: <EOF> after : "[]"

Lucene does not implement a standalone "NOT" query.  (Probably BooleanQuery
should throw an exception if all clauses are prohibited clauses.)  Negation
is only implemented with respect to other non-negated clauses.

So you cannot directly model your query tree as a Lucene query tree.  NOT
nodes must be incorporated into their parent, a BooleanQuery node, as is
done in your "directly" case.

     I wrote something up a few months ago, and posted it to the list.
I've been meaning to get back to it, edit it again, spiff it up a bit,
maybe come up with some updated code for the examples written on my own
time (instead of my employers) so I can publish it, etc.  But right now,
the current draft is at:
